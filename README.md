The first lab for BYU CS 235 taken Fall 2018. The program is supposed to use inheritance from classes provided to make
an arena and different classes of fighters and then simulate battles between fighters. Lab specs can be found here:

I was a little rusty after not programming much over the summer so I didn't quite get 100% on this assignment.
