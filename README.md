The first lab for BYU CS 235 taken Fall 2018. The program is supposed to use inheritance from classes provided to make
an arena and different classes of fighters. Then the fighters would battle.

I was a little rusty after not programming much over the summer so I didn't quite get 100% on this assignment.
